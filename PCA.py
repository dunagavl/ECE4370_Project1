# initialize with input data d, where d is N x M array where N
#   is the number of samples and M is the number of features
# Example usage:
# > d = np.random.rand(5,2) # 5 samples of a 2 feature process
# > p = pca(d)
# > d_pca = p.project(d) # returns coordinates of samples in the pca linear vector space
